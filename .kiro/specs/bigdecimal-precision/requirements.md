# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the conversion of the DCF Calculator application from using Double precision floating-point numbers to BigDecimal for all financial calculations and data storage. This change is necessary to maintain exact precision in financial calculations and prevent rounding errors that can occur with floating-point arithmetic, especially when dealing with large monetary values that may be displayed in scientific notation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Model Precision Conversion

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all financial data models to use BigDecimal instead of Double, so that financial values maintain exact precision without floating-point rounding errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is stored in entities THEN the system SHALL use BigDecimal for all monetary and percentage fields
2. WHEN financial data is transferred via DTOs THEN the system SHALL use BigDecimal for all numerical financial fields
3. WHEN financial data is validated THEN the system SHALL maintain BigDecimal precision throughout validation logic
4. WHEN financial data is serialized to JSON THEN the system SHALL preserve exact decimal representation without scientific notation

### Requirement 2: Calculation Service Precision

**User Story:** As a user performing DCF calculations, I want all mathematical operations to maintain exact precision, so that my investment analysis is based on accurate financial computations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DCF calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL use BigDecimal arithmetic for all mathematical operations
2. WHEN growth rates and discount rates are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain precision using BigDecimal operations
3. WHEN present value calculations are computed THEN the system SHALL use BigDecimal with appropriate rounding modes
4. WHEN final fair value is calculated THEN the system SHALL return BigDecimal result with consistent decimal places

### Requirement 3: API Layer Precision Handling

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want API responses to contain exact decimal values, so that financial data displays correctly without scientific notation in the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is returned via REST APIs THEN the system SHALL serialize BigDecimal as plain decimal strings
2. WHEN DCF calculation results are returned THEN the system SHALL format BigDecimal values with appropriate decimal places
3. WHEN API requests contain financial parameters THEN the system SHALL parse string values to BigDecimal accurately
4. WHEN validation errors occur with BigDecimal values THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages

### Requirement 4: Database Precision Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want financial data stored in the database to maintain exact precision, so that historical calculations remain accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is persisted to database THEN the system SHALL store BigDecimal values with sufficient precision and scale
2. WHEN financial data is retrieved from database THEN the system SHALL maintain BigDecimal precision without data loss
3. WHEN database migrations are performed THEN the system SHALL convert existing Double columns to appropriate DECIMAL types
4. WHEN financial calculations are cached THEN the system SHALL preserve BigDecimal precision in cached values

### Requirement 5: Frontend Integration and Display

**User Story:** As an end user, I want financial values to display as readable decimal numbers, so that I can easily interpret investment data without scientific notation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is received from APIs THEN the frontend SHALL handle BigDecimal string values correctly
2. WHEN financial values are displayed in charts THEN the system SHALL format BigDecimal values appropriately for visualization
3. WHEN users input financial parameters THEN the system SHALL validate and convert to BigDecimal format
4. WHEN calculation results are shown THEN the system SHALL display BigDecimal values with consistent decimal formatting
